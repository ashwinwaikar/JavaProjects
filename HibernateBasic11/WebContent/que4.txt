4)create two entities "Course" and "Module"

Module
	id [auto generated]
	name
	

Course
	id [auto generated]
	name
	Set<Module> modules;  // one to many

create a "Form.jsp"
	which will accept

Enter Course name:  
	Module_1:
	Module_2:
	Module_3:

		save

on click of "save" it should go to "CourseServ" which will create objects of "Course and Module". 
Add Module objects in Set and associate it with "Course" object. Finally it has to persist Course 
inside database using hibernate.

create "ShowServ",which will query database for getting Course objects.store them in ArrayList.
 add ArrayList inside "request" scope and forward to "Del.jsp". 
Del.jsp will retrieve all the objects from request scope , and show their name along with hyperlink "delete".
 if we click delete, control should go to "DelServ" which will delete that particular Course.

inside Del.jsp give hyperlink as

	<a href="Delserv? id=${var.id}"> delete</a>
